A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a way of building web services that allows communication between a client (like a browser or mobile app) and a server over the HTTP protocol, following a set of architectural principles.

*REST API (Representational State Transfer API):
    -It is based on Client-Server Architecture – client and server are independent, communicating via HTTP.
    -Response format can be in any type – JSON (most common), XML, HTML, or plain text.
    -It respects HTTP methods and their semantics:
        -GET → Retrieve data (should not modify resources).
        -POST → Create a new resource.
        -PUT → Update/replace an existing resource.
        -PATCH → Partially update a resource.
        -DELETE → Remove a resource.
